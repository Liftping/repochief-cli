## 🚨 Critical Path Blockers

1. **Authentication Setup** - MUST fix first
2. **Cloud API Deployment** - Required for sync
3. **Dashboard Access** - Need to verify working

## 📝 Immediate Action Items

### Priority 1: Fix Authentication
```bash
# 1. Debug auth flow
node bin/repochief.js auth login --debug

# 2. Check token storage
ls -la ~/.repochief/

# 3. Verify API connectivity
curl https://api.repochief.com/health
```

### Priority 2: Fix Cloud Progress API
```bash
# Check if API is deployed
curl -X GET https://api.repochief.com/api/progress/health

# Check correct endpoint
grep -r "api/progress" src/
```

### Priority 3: Test Dashboard
1. Navigate to https://beta.repochief.com
2. Attempt login
3. Document any errors
4. Check browser console for issues

## 🔄 Next Test Iteration

Once authentication is fixed, rerun tests:

```bash
# 1. Complete auth
repochief auth login

# 2. Test intent creation
repochief intent create \
  --objective "Test dogfooding" \
  --business-value "Validate workflow"

# 3. Run with cloud sync
repochief run examples/repochief-dogfooding-tasks.json \
  --output dogfood-cloud-test

# 4. Check dashboard
open https://beta.repochief.com/intents
```

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Create Setup Script**: Automate the initial setup process
2. **Add Health Check Command**: `repochief doctor` to diagnose issues
3. **Improve Error Messages**: Cloud sync errors should be clearer
4. **Add Offline Mode**: Gracefully handle cloud unavailability
5. **Document Fallbacks**: Explain keychain alternatives

## 📈 Progress Since Last Test

- ✅ Fixed mock mode execution bugs
- ✅ Organized workspace files
- ✅ Created dogfooding test suite
- ✅ Documented workflow requirements
- ⏳ Authentication still pending
- ⏳ Cloud integration still pending

---

**Conclusion**: RepoCHief can execute tasks locally but needs authentication and cloud integration fixed before it can truly dogfood its own development. The core engine works, but the full workflow is blocked by auth/cloud issues.
